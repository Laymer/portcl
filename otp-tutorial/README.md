# OTP Interoperability Tutorial - Ports

This subdirectory contains the example programs found in section 8.4 of
the OTP System Documentation.

The main exception is that the C program in the example has been replaced
with a Tcl script.

Run `make`, or just `erlc complex1`,  to compile the erlang module.
